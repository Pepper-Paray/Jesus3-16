                The lord gave us a gift named jesus. He didn't came to commdem the world but to save us.
                God only begotten son came to shed his blood to wash us clean. For 30 some years, he walked
                the earth with us teaching us the truth. He had 12 men who walk with jesus to speard god message.
                He, the son of god, spent time with sinners and sick people. To help them see the light that he
                was trying to shine on the earth. He was here for us. To rescuse us from our own sin. He laid down
                his life for mine as well as yours. Jesus is the way and the only way. God loves his son but wanted to
                save mankind. Jesus gave us the greatest gift ever known,entral life.
